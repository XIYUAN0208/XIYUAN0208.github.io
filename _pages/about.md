I am a first year PhD student at the [Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University](https://www.fi.muni.cz/), working under the supervision of [Daniel Kr√°l'](https://www.ucw.cz/~kral/) at the [DIMEA](https://www.fi.muni.cz/research/laboratories/dimea.html) laboratory. I received my master's degree from the [ShanDong University](https://en.sdu.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Guanghui Wang](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/wangguanghui1/en/index.htm).
